# Type Theory

Course was designed and taught by [Dmitry Shtukenberg](https://github.com/shd) at ITMO University in 2019 (year2017, 5th semester).

## Labs

1. Parenthesis placement in lambda expression
2. Normalization of lambda expression
3. Type inference simply typed lambda calculus

All [solutions (ru)](/lab/tasks.pdf) are stored in one file. In addition to main directory with [solutions](/lab) in Java, here is also a [solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-tt/tree/master/parser) of the first task in Haskell.


## Homeworks

* List of all theoretical [is available on course page (ru)](https://github.com/shd/tt2019/blob/master/hw-theory.pdf).
* There are also statements of additional tasks, the solutions of which are mathematical proofs, written in Idris.
    * This repository contains [my solutions of tasks](/hw)
    * Course page have [examples of programs on Idris](https://github.com/shd/tt2019/tree/master/idris-examples)
